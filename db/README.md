This folder is a good place to put your sqlite database during development, so
you can put the path to this folder in your `kive/settings.py`
file. For example, if you checked out this project from git into
`/home/joe/git/Kive`, then you would find the settings file at
`/home/joe/git/Kive/kive/kive/settings.py`, and you would use a database
name of `/home/joe/git/Kive/db/kive.db`.

This README file is mostly here to make git create the `db` folder.
